    "# Formulating the DFT problem mathematically\n",

    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "- The aim of density-functional theory (DFT) is to find an approximate description of the electronic structure, without solving the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation.\n",
    "- We consider here the **discretised setting** in which e.g. a plane-wave basis of **size $N_b$** is used.\n",
    "- We describe the unknowns of our problem in terms of **density matrices** $P$, self-adjoint operators $P$ with $0 \\leq P \\leq 1$, which can be diagonalised\n",
    "$$ P = \\sum_i^{N_b} f_i |\\phi_i\\rangle \\langle \\phi_i|. $$\n",
    "with **occupation numbers** $0 \\leq f_i \\leq 1$ and orbitals $\\phi_i$.\n",
    "- As discussed the DFT solution is found by solving a **minimisation problem**\n",
    "  $$ \\min_{P\\in\\mathcal{P}} \\mathcal{E}(P) $$\n",
    "  where the set of admissable density matrices is\n",
    "  $$ \\mathcal{P} = \\left\\{P \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N_b \\times N_b}, P^\\dagger = P, 0 < P < 1 \\right\\}. $$\n",
    "- We work in the *grand-canonical ensemble*: We fix a chemical potential $\\mu$ and an inverse temperature $\\beta = 1/T$. Note that in this setting the number of electrons is *not fixed*. This is done to simplify the presented mathematical expressions, as e.g. fixing $N$ instead of $\\mu$ would introduce extra constraints yielding additional terms in some of the expressions presented here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this ensemble the appropriate energy to minimise is the **free energy** given by\n",
    "  $$ \\mathcal{E}(P) = \\mathcal{E}_0(P) - \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\mathrm{Tr}[s(P)] - \\mu \\mathrm{Tr}(P). $$\n",

    "## Density mixing\n",
    "\n",
    "- The formalism presented above (based on the density matrix $P$) is general, e.g. could also be applied to the Hartree-Fock problem or Hybrid-DFT if the functional $\\mathcal{E}_0$ is modified appropriately.\n",
    "- From the point of view of a numerical implementation it has, however, the disadvantage that it requires to treat density matrices, i.e. objects of size $N_b \\times N_b$. This is challenging in particular for \"large\" basis sets (such as plane waves) where $N_b$ is regularly of the order of $10^5$ or $10^6$.\n",
    "- For semi-local DFT one is able to formulate the problem as a minimisation over only the density $\\rho$. This is advantageous since the density is an object of only size $N_b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To see this we collect the linear terms (kinetic energy and external interaction with the nuclei) in the **core Hamiltonian** $H_0$ and the non-linear terms in $g$, the Hartree-exchange-correlation energy. We then write\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\\mathcal{E}_0(P) = \\mathrm{Tr}\\left(H_0 P\\right) + g(\\text{diag} P)$$\n",
    "  where $\\rho = \\text{diag} P$ is the density density corresponding to $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introducing the **Hartree-exchange-correlation potential**\n",
    "  $$ V(\\rho) = \\nabla g(\\rho) $$\n",

    "  $$ \\rho = \\text{diag} \\Big( f_\\text{FD}\\left[ H_0 + \\text{diagm}\\, V(\\rho) \\right] \\Big) = D(V(\\rho)) = F(\\rho)$$\n",

    "- When running a calculation in DFTK (like we did in the [previous notebook](0_first_practical_calculation.ipynb)), DFTK first inspects the molecule to guess an initial density $\\rho_0$.\n",
    "- Then we solve $ \\rho = D(V(\\rho)) $ by computing\n",
    "  $D(V(\\rho_n))$ for a sequence of iterates $\\rho_n$ until input and output\n",
    "  are close enough, i.e. the residual\n",
    "  $$ R(\\rho_n) = D(V(\\rho_n)) - \\rho_n$$\n",
